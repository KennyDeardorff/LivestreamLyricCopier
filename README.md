# Livestream Lyric Copier


1. Paste lyrics into app. Format as needed - contiguous lines will be placed into the same cell. A blank line will move to the next cell. Two blank lines in a row will move two cells down.
2. Change the delay method, if desired.

   1. Wait for 'Insert' key press - Waits for the user to press the 'Insert' key before copying the lyrics. To use this mode, once you click "Copy to LiveStream Studio", go to the LiveStream app and enter the edit mode on the cell you want to start pasting into. Once in edit mode, press the 'Insert' key and the Lyric Copier will begin copying text to LiveStream Studio.
   2. Wait 'X' seconds - This method waits the specified number of seconds before starting to copy text to LiveStream Studio. This could be useful if using the 'Insert' key does not work for some reason (e.g. LiveStream Studio uses Insert as a hotkey for something that causes the cell to leave edit mode)
3. Click "Copy to LiveStream Studio".
